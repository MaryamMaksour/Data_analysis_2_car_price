# car price prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting car prices using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. It aims to provide insights into the factors influencing car prices and to develop predictive models for accurate price estimation. Key features include:

1- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between features like brand, mileage, year, and price.

2- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling data for model training.

3- Machine Learning Models: Implementation of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict car prices.

4- Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying the most critical features that impact car prices.

5- Visualization: Graphical representation of data and model results for better interpretability.

6- Model Evaluation: Assessing the models' performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Objective
To develop a data-driven solution that helps users or businesses estimate the price of a car based on its attributes. This project can be useful for buyers, sellers, and dealerships aiming to make informed pricing decisions.
